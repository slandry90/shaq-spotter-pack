spmsg01

; The msgId is the trigger for a sample.  If you want to add
; variety you can record multiple versions of a sample and tie
; each one to the same message id.  We will randomly select
; from the samples you provide.
;
; You can currently have up to 100 unique samples per message id.
; Each string message can be up to 512 characters in length.
; For example the SPCC_PITCOMPLETE message has 8 unique samples
; when triggered we will select one of the eight to play back at random.
;
; Feel free to add or remove samples, but leave at least one of each type of msgId.
;
; Numbers 0-9, multiples of 10 (10, 20, 30 etc), and
; multiples of 100 and 1000 must be recorded
; you can optionally record the other numbers if they can't be
; easily created by combining the above together.
;
; For example in english we say 'eleven' rather than 'ten one'
; so we need to record an SPCC_N11 sample.  However we say
; 'twenty one' so the default of SPCC_N20 + SPCC_N1 is good enough.
;
; Add the word NULL in place of a wave file or text string
; to stop a sample from playing.
;
; The SPCC_xxx_RESTART messages are optional and are nulled out by default.
; If you fill them in they will be called when restarting a race rather
; than the origional start messages.
